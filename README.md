# Hello, world!

My name is Elizaveta Ershova. I study [computational linguistics](https://www.hse.ru/ba/ling/) at Higher School of Economics and do science at [Learner Corpora Lab](https://www.hse.ru/staff/eershova#sci) :)

I'm intrested in working on NLP projects. 
My areas of interest are:
- Sentiment Analysis 
- Grammatical Error Correction 

Here are my relevant projects:
- Sentiment Analysis of comments in VK communities [website](http://vksentiment.pythonanywhere.com), [source code](https://github.com/eoershova/vk-sentiment). Done in collaboration with Ann Kopaeva
- Automatic Error Identification and Classification for Learners of English with Russian as their L1 [website](http://adwiser.pythonanywhere.com). I manage this project at the Lab
- Twitter Sentiment Analysis [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/eoershova/HW8). Done as homework.
